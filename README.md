### 👋 About Me
Tech leader, architect, and engineer who loves solving messy business problems, building scalable cloud platforms, and creating AI‑powered experiences that make people say, “whoa.”
I turn complex enterprise needs into clean architectures, high‑impact demos, and hands‑on solutions that actually get adopted.

### 🧠 What I Actually Do
<br/>
🤖 I create practical AI systems—GenAI, agentic workflows, and ML—that solve real problems.<br/>
🧊 Build scalable Lakehouse and modern data analytics solutions.<br/>
🧱 Modernize legacy platforms → microservices + cloud‑native<br/>
🎤 Lead architecture workshops, exec discussions & whiteboarding battles<br/>
⚙️ Build POCs that close deals and unlock big value<br/>
👨‍💻 Still write code — because real architects ship things<br/>


### 🛠️ My Toolbox<br/>
Data & Analytics: Snowflake • SQL • Lakehouse • ETL/ELT<br/>
AI/ML: GenAI • Predictive Analytics • Feature Engineering<br/>
Cloud: Azure • Kubernetes • Docker<br/>
Integration: Kafka • RabbitMQ • MuleSoft<br/>
Programming: Python • SQL • C# • .NET/Core<br/>
Architecture: Microservices • Event‑Driven • DDD • Cloud‑Native<br/>

### 🚀 My (Slightly Dramatic) Career Journey
It all started with a simple idea: “Hey, computers are cool. Let’s make this a career.”<br/>
So I went all in—Bachelor’s and Master’s in Computer Science, because why stop at one degree when you can debug your thesis twice?<br/>
🧑‍💻 **Level 1**: Software Engineer
Bright‑eyed, caffeinated, and armed with far too many tabs open, I wrote code like my life depended on it. Some of that code even worked on the first try. (Some…)<br/>
🧑‍💻💪 **Level 2**: Senior Software Engineer
Eventually, someone noticed I could solve problems without asking Stack Overflow every time. That earned me the “Senior” title.<br/>
🧑‍🔧 **Level 3**: Tech Lead
Suddenly, I wasn’t just fixing bugs—I was reviewing other people’s bugs.
I also learned the ancient art of saying, “It depends.”<br/>
✈️ **Plot Twist**: Moved to the US<br/>
Packed my bags, crossed an ocean, and discovered that even in new time zones, production issues still find you.<br/>
🧑‍🏫 **Level 4**: Software Consultant<br>
Now I was directly working with clients—translating tech jargon into human language, and sometimes the other way around. Bonus points for surviving meetings where someone says, “Should be easy, right?”<br/>
🏗️ **Level 5**: Application Architect<br/>
Architected applications. Drew diagrams. Lots of diagrams.
People started asking me for “the architecture,” and suddenly my whiteboard markers became my most prized possessions. Still continued to ship production code.<br/>
🏛️ **Level 6**: Solution Architect<br/>
Zoomed out even further. Connected systems, platforms, and ideas like a digital puzzle master.
Learned that every solution comes with… just a tiny bit of scope creep.<br/>
🏢 **Level 7**: Enterprise Architect<br/>
Now we’re talking big picture—aligning strategy, technology, and business goals, while pretending all three like each other.<br/>
🤖🌐 **Final Form (for now)**: Principal / Director, Data & AI Engineering
Today, I live where data meets AI, and I help organizations build the future—responsibly, scalably, and with just the right amount of nerdiness.
Still caffeinated. Still curious. Still writing code. Still having fun.
