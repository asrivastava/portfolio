👋 Hey, I’m Anshuman Srivastava<p/>
Tech leader, architect, and engineer who loves solving messy data problems, building scalable cloud platforms, and creating AI-powered experiences that make people go “whoa.”
I convert complex enterprise needs into clean architectures, high‑impact demos, and hands-on solutions that actually get adopted.

🧠 What I Actually Do
<p/>
🧊 Design enterprise Snowflake Lakehouse ecosystems<br/>
🤖 Build real-world GenAI, ML, and analytics solutions<br/>
🧱 Modernize legacy platforms → microservices + cloud‑native<br/>
🎤 Lead architecture workshops, exec discussions & whiteboarding battles<br/>
⚙️ Build POCs that close deals and unlock big value<br/>
👨‍💻 Still write code — because real architects ship things<br/>
